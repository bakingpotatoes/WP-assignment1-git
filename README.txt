***SOME DISCLAIMERS*** 
I wrote 90% of my newest css with scss selectors unfortunately, I didn't realise this fact until the last minute

***DUE TO PAST EXPERIENCES, I'VE LINKED THIS ASSIGNMENT TO MY GITHUB ACCOUNT SO I CAN GO BACK ON PREVIOUS VERSIONS IN THE CASE SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS
KINDLY IGNORE THE .gitatttributes and README.md, IT'S JUST FOR LOCAL VERSION CONTROLS***

.gitignore is just to tell git commit to ignore the other readme.md... and no frontend frameworks were used during this assignment...

You may notice that there are some extra buttons that don't do anything, I added most just for the looks, it doesn't have anything to do with the core purpose of
having buttons in this assignment...


---About my folders and organisation---
I STORED ALL RELATED HTML AND CSS FILES IN THE SAME FOLDERS


**Index**
Landing page, nothing special except for some really bad css, but everything has a beginning

**Images**
Where I stored all my images as per the assignment guidelines

**AboutUs/AboutMe**
So about my page, there is an AboutUs, which may sounds strange; "are there more of you?", no, I originally made it with the intention of adding multiple fake 
people, but in the end, just addded myself in the later AboutMe, which is about me, I kept it this way to make my project seem more complete

**Contact**
Very straight forward, this has a form for regular people and students, when you submit your form,
it takes you to a submitted.html page that gives you the option to return to the homepage or to make another form, there's no PHP elements tho, its just a facade

**Shop** 
The most complex folder, this part contains a basic storefront that you're greeted with. Here, you can add stuff to your cart, for a deeper and more detailed shopping experience,
feel free to click on the product's frame itself, it will take you to a page that shows you a more accessible shopping page, there's also a cart that you can access with the top nav
shopping cart icon, where you will see all the items you picked out individually, and where you can remove items, add discounts and proceed to payment of your cart
